"""UpgradeService (TD-06-T2) — grant an employee a new capability on approval.

North star §1.4: an employee that hits a "I have the task but not the tool" gap
doesn't just fail — it submits a capability-upgrade request (an approval of
type ``capability_upgrade``). When the owner approves (confirming/adjusting the
capability key), this service resolves the capability bundle from the catalog,
installs it onto the employee's Hermes profile via ``ProfileProvisioner``, and
records it in ``agent_capabilities`` so the employee keeps the ability for future
runs.

If the capability needs credentials the employee doesn't have yet, the row is
recorded as ``credential_missing`` (the existing credentials flow then asks the
owner for them) rather than ``enabled``.
